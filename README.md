# Cryptography-DigitalSignature

 ## This is a simple code that performs 
 1- Symmetric Cryptography on a single file or on a folder containing multiple files.
 
 2- Digital Signature using SHA-256 and RSA
- You can choose the task to be performed, the encryption algorithm; DES or AES, and whether it's performed on a file or a folder.
- Please note that digital signature is only performed on single files.


- crpytography.java is the source code file. 
- The code contains 3 classes
1- Encryption/ decryption class
2- Digital Signature
3- Main Class

- Each method and part of the code is preceeded by a comment for clarity
- You can test the code with the files and folders in TestFilesFolders
 
Feel free to edit the code and customize it to your preference :)
